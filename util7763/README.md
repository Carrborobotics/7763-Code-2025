Some simple utilities to preview how some LED routines will look before we hook them up to a robot.

These need work to be more plug-and-play with the actual robot code, this is a work in progress.

To test out the display (which uses Java Swing/AWT guis):

```sh
javac FireStripGUI.java && java FireStripGUI
javac WaveStripGUI.java && java WaveStripGUI
```
